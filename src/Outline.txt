Todo app using React, Redux, SQL, and ASP.NET

We want this app to be able to do a few things.
1. Record Task under the specified model within the taskmodel class.
2. Set up a list of tasks that I can choose from to put into my daily work. 
3. Remove task from daily work.
4. Specify that a task is completed.
5. Filter by task status (join in SQL), importance level, and other information that I decide important when I actually get around to building the thing. 
6. Funny memes and other task
7. Make it my website somewhere? I'm all game for making this public information.

notes:
if in progress, it is put into daily work automatically
Have an easy to access notepad for each task via relational table
